                    <p>George Louis Costanza is a character in the American television sitcom Seinfeld (1989â€“1998), played by Jason Alexander. He has variously been described as a "brain-damaged, short, stocky, slow-witted, ugly, old, bald man" (by Elaine Benes and Costanza himself) and "Lord of the Idiots" (by Costanza himself). George and Jerry were junior high school friends and remained friends afterwards.</p>
